		<h1>News</h1>
		<p style="padding-left:50px">Hmm, what's some good news... YouthDevs is starting, of course! We have worked hard on these first products, and they are probably very glitchy, because they are in beta (obviously). If you find any bugs, make sure to contact us.</p>

		<p style="padding-left:50px">We have just released The Box Trials, a platformer based game where you visit a factory which (sometimes) tests user's skills. We have also got Loop Hole, a very glitchy puzzle game, where you break physics and reality. People like that, right? Our final release for now is Shire, where you jump, shoot, and fire (hehe) through a level. Equipped with a grappling hook and zap gun, make your way through giant landscapes.</p>
